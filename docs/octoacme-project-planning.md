# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by PM and Scrum Master)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (led by Product Manager with UX Designer input)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) with Developers
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) including quality, documentation, and deployment criteria
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (coordinate with DevOps Engineer)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (involving Technical Writer for documentation timeline)

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length (facilitated by Scrum Master)
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected
- UX Designer confirms design specs are ready for selected items
- DevOps Engineer validates infrastructure readiness for upcoming features

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
